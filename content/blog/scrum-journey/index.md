# My Journey: Navigating the Career Change from QA Automation Engineer to Certified Scrum Master

The world of technology is ever-evolving, and with it comes a plethora of career opportunities. One such opportunity that I explored was making the career change from a Quality Assurance (QA) Automation Engineer to a Certified Scrum Master (CSM). It may seem like a significant shift, but it can be a rewarding move that leads to personal and professional growth. In this blog post, I'll share my experience of making this transition, the skills I acquired to succeed as a Scrum Master, and the steps I took to become a Certified Scrum Master.

Why did I make the change?
As a QA Automation Engineer, my role was vital in the software development process, ensuring that the end product was of high quality and free from defects. However, after spending years in the same role, I yearned for a change to broaden my horizons and acquire new skills.

A Scrum Master is an essential part of an Agile team, responsible for facilitating and coaching the team to ensure a smooth development process. This role is highly interactive and requires excellent communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills. I decided that making the transition from QA Automation Engineer to Scrum Master would provide new challenges and opportunities for career growth.

Skills I acquired for my new role as a Scrum Master:
While QA Automation Engineers and Scrum Masters have different roles, there are some overlapping skills that helped me during the transition.

Communication: Both roles require strong communication skills to convey information effectively to team members and stakeholders. I honed my communication skills further to excel as a Scrum Master.
Collaboration: As a Scrum Master, I needed to be adept at working with diverse teams and fostering an environment of cooperation and trust.
Problem-solving: I developed my problem-solving skills to identify and resolve impediments that hindered the team's progress.
Adaptability: I learned to be comfortable with change and adjusted my approach as needed since the Agile process is iterative.
Steps I Took to become a Certified Scrum Master:
a. Understand Agile and Scrum principles: To make the transition, I first gained a strong grasp of Agile and Scrum principles. I utilized various online resources, books, and courses to build a solid foundation.

b. Gain practical experience: I found that hands-on experience was invaluable. I participated in Agile projects at my workplace and collaborated with Agile teams to gain insights into the Scrum Master's role.

c. Attend a Certified Scrum Master training course: To become a Certified Scrum Master, I attended a two-day training course from a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST). The course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the Scrum framework, roles, and responsibilities, as well as real-world examples and exercises.

d. Pass the CSM exam: After completing the training, I passed the CSM exam, which consists of multiple-choice questions. The exam assessed my understanding of Scrum principles, practices, and roles.

e. Maintain my certification: To keep my CSM certification valid, I earned Scrum Education Units (SEUs) by participating in Scrum-related events, conferences, and workshops. This ongoing learning helped me stay up-to-date with the latest Scrum practices and developments.


Making the career change from QA Automation Engineer to Certified Scrum Master was a rewarding experience that opened up new opportunities for personal and professional growth. By building on my existing skills, gaining practical experience, and obtaining my CSM certification, I became an effective and successful Scrum Master. If you're considering a similar transition, I hope my journey can inspire and guide you.
